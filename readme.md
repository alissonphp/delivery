## Delivery

Delivery is a project started with the intention of being a platform that integrates between restaurants that have delivery services and the consumers. So far, there is already an order simulation, calculating the totals, delivery rate and custom ordering. It still has many features and code and layout improvements to implement. In the future it will be integrated with the main forms of online payment available in the market.
